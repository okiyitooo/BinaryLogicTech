java is platform independent (run on any device) because
the byte code(.class) file on any system as it is machine readable since you don't have to compile it again.
 
JDK - Java Development Kit -> contains
	- JRE - Java Runtime Environment -> contains
	- JVM - Java Virtual Machine -> contains
	- JIT - Just in Time Compiler
 
JDK - lets you write java code. Plus has development tools and compiler called javaC to write code.
 
JRE - has library to run java code.
 
JVM - reads the code line by line
 
JIT - saves machine code for all the work done so far as to not repeat conversion again and again
 
class loader - loading(converts code to binary data)
             - linking(links data to referenced data)
 
garbage collection - manages memory (ex= if there is a data that does not have any reference it is eligible for garbage collection) at the end of the program everything will go to garbage collection.

Heap vs stack
If you declare a variable, it’s reference is stored in the stack, while the value is stored in the heap
In java everything primitive is passed by value in functions
SCP = *A singleton* string constant pool, (when a  string is assigned to a variable, JVM checks to see if it is in the pool, if it is already in the pool, the variable simply points to the string as opposed to making a new string. If a string is created without a reference, it does not join the pool) “increases efficiency”
Garbage collector collects values without references
String = Strings are immutable because if you modify one that is being pointed to by another, the other would be affected

Runtime polymorphism is when jvm decides which function to run at runtime based on parameter difference

If there’s no modifier before a variable type, its modifier is default (this limits access to only inside the class

Control Flow of static
1- static blocks methods and variables are identified
2-  static things  are executed and assigned
3-  main is executed

*Compile time polymorphism
